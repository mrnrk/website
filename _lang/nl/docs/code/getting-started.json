    "Getting Started": "Aan de slag",
    "Welcome to the elementary Developer Guide! This book was created to teach you all about creating and distributing apps for elementary OS. The introduction will make sure that you have all the tools for the job and a solid understanding of what this book is about. Some of you may feel confident enough to jump straight into coding. If that's the case, you might want to skip ahead and start writing your first app.": "Welkom bij de elementary ontwikkelaarsgids! Dit boek is gemaakt om je alles te leren over het maken en verspreiden van apps voor elementary OS. De introductie zorgt ervoor dat je alle benodigde gereedschappen voor je doel hebt en een goed begrip van waar dit boek over gaat. Als je genoeg vertrouwen hebt om meteen te beginnen met je applicatie, kun je overwegen om meteen te beginnen aan het schrijven van je eerste applicatie.",
    "However, we strongly recommend to at least skim through this preparation step. Having the right setup is going to help you reach your goals faster, and having a solid foundation is going to help you throughout the rest of this book.": "Echter wordt het door ons aangeraden om tenminste de voorbereidingsstap te lezen. Door een juiste inrichting te hebben, kan je je doelen sneller behalen, en het hebben van een goede basis gaat je helpen om dit boek door te komen.",
    "What We Will And Won't Cover": "Wat we wel en niet zullen bespreken",
    "We're going to assume that you have absolutely no experience in writing apps for elementary. But we will assume some basic programming knowledge, and hopefully a little experience in Vala or at least similarly syntaxed languages. If you're not familiar with Vala, we highly encourage you to brush up on it before coming here.": "We gaan ervanuit dat je absoluut geen ervaring hebt in het schrijven van apps voor elementary. Wel gaan we ervanuit dat je de basis van programmeren kent, en hopelijk een beetje ervaring hebt in Vala of talen met een vergelijkbare syntax. Als je niet bekend bent met Vala, raden we je aan om er wat meer over te lezen voordat je hiermee begint.",
    "We’re also not covering design too much in this guide; that’s what the <a href=\"/docs/human-interface-guidelines\">Human Interface Guidelines</a> (HIG) are for, and you’re highly encouraged to take a look there before beginning your app. We're going to assume you have a basic knowledge of (or at least a quick link to) the HIG and focus on coding. However, elementary is all about great design and stellar consistency. It’s important you grasp these concepts before moving on.": "We gaan ook niet te diep in op design in deze gids; dat is waar de <a href=\"/docs/human-interface-guidelines\">Human Interface Guidelines</a> (HIG) voor dienen, en we raden je sterk aan om deze eens te bekijken voor je je app begint. We gaan ervan uit dat je basiskennis hebt van (of ten minste een link hebt met) het HIG en focus op coderen. \nElementary gaat echter wel over fantastisch design en stellaire consistentie. Het is belangrijk dat je deze concepten goed begrijpt voordat je verder gaat.",
    "In this book, we're going to talk about building apps using GTK+, Granite, and other tech available in elementary, setting up a build system, hosting your code for collaborative development, working with translations, a few other bits and pieces, and finally packaging and distributing your new app.": "In dit boek zullen we kijken naar het bouwen van apps met GTK+, Granite en andere tech beschikbaar in elementary, het instellen van een build systeem, het hosten van code voor gedeelde ontwikkeling, het werken met translations, wat andere kleine onderdelen en uiteindelijk het inpakken en distribueren van je nieuwe app.",
    "The Basic Setup": "De Basis Setup",
    "Before we even think about writing code, you'll need a certain basic setup. This chapter will walk you through the process of getting set up. We will cover the following topics:": "Voordat we zelfs ook maar beginnen met denken over het schrijven van code, heb je een bepaalde basis setup nodig.

This is important as the instructions you’re given may reference apps that are not present (or even available) in other Linux based operating systems like Ubuntu. It is possible to apply the principles of this guide to Ubuntu development, but it may be more difficult to follow along.": "We gaan er vanuit dat je werkt vanuit een schone installatie van elementary OS Freya of later. Dit is belangrijk omdat de instructies die je gegeven worden wellicht zillen refereren naar apps die, in andere linux-gebaseerde besturingssystemen zoals Ubuntu, niet aanwezig (of zelfs beschikbaar) zijn. Het is wel mogelijk om de principes uit deze handleiding te gebruiken voor Ubuntu ontwikkeling, maar het is mogelijk lastiger te volgen.",

    "Launchpad is a free online service provided by Canonical, the same people who brought you Ubuntu. It is used as a platform for hosting code, tracking milestones, tracking bugs, proposing designs, making translations, and more. Launchpad is a powerful resource, especially if you are a developer working with others. We're going to be using it for its various features throughout this book, so it's a good idea for you to sign up for an account. If you already have an account, feel free to move on to the next section.": "Launchpad is een gratis online dienst aangeboden door Canonical, dezelfde mensen die je Ubuntu brachten. Het wordt gebruikt als platform om code te huisvesten, mijlpalen bij te houden, bugs bij te houden, designs voor te stellen, vertalingen te maken enz. Launchpad is een krachtige bron, zeker als je werkt met andere ontwikkelaars. We gaan het gebruiken voor zijn vele eigenschappen doorheen dit boek, dus is het een goed idee om er een account op te hebben. Als je reeds een account hebt, voel je dan vrij om over te gaan naar het volgende deel.",
    "To set up a Launchpad account:": "Om een Launchpad account aan te maken:",

We'll come back to Launchpad a few times later on to use specific features, but if you really want to learn everything there is to know about the website you should read their user guide.
