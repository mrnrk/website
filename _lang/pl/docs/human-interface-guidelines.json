    "Your application will appear native to the desktop and share the same elegant look as default applications.": "Twoja aplikacja pojawi się natywnie na pulpicie i nabierze tego samego eleganckiego wyglądu jak inne domyślne aplikacje. ",
    "Your application will be easier to document because an expected behavior does not require explanation.": "Twoja aplikacja będzie łatwiejsza do udokumentowania, gdyż spodziewane zachowanie nie będzie wymagało wyjaśnienia. ",
    "The amount of support you will have to provide, including bugs filed, will be lessened (for the reasons above).": "Dzięki powyższym przykładom mniej ludzi będzie potrzebowało pomocy podczas korzystania z systemu.",
    "To help you achieve these goals, these guidelines will cover basic interface elements, how to use them and put them together effectively, and how to make your application integrate well with the desktop. The most important thing to remember is that following these guidelines will make it easier to design a new application, not harder.": "Wytyczne te będą pokrywały podstawowe zasady tworzenia poszczególnych elementów interfejsu, przypadków ich stosowania oraz łączenia efektywnie w całość. Dzięki temu twoja aplikacja będzie bardzo dobrze integrowała się z systemem. Należy pamiętać, że te wytyczne zostały stworzone z myślą ułatwienia projektowania aplikacji, a nie odwrotnie.",

For a quick crash course, we like &quot;The User is Drunk&quot;:": "Elementary HIG nie jest zbiorem twardych zasad; jego przeznaczeniem jest być elastycznym i rozwojowym. Pierwsza porcja wytycznych dotyczy samej filozofii którą przyjęliśmy. Upraszczając jest to zasada, polegająca na założeniu że \"Użytkownik jest pijany\":",
    "What Design Is Not": "Czym NIE jest design",
    "Before we get into all the things that make up elementary apps, there is a clarification that needs to be made. We need to understand what exactly design is about, but more importantly we want to smash two major myths:": "Zanim zagłębimy się w temat tworzenia aplikacji dla systemu elementary musimy coś wyjaśnić. Trzeba zrozumieć czym właściwie jest design oraz na początek obalić dwa główne mity:",
    "<strong>Design is not something you add on after you've completed a product.</strong> Whether you realize it or not, you are constantly designing anything you build. It is an intrinsic part of creating something. Design is not just what something looks like. It's not just the colors and fonts. Design is how it works. When you decide to add a button that does a thing, that is design. You made a decision to add a button with an icon or a label and where that button went and the size and color of that button. Decisions are designs.": "<strong>Design to nie jest coś co dodajesz PO ukończeniu produktu.</strong> Czy zdajesz sobie z tego sprawę czy nie, powinieneś bez przerwy projektować to co budujesz. Jest to wewnętrzna część procesu tworzenia. Design to nie jest po prostu wygląd. Nie składa się on z kolorów i czcionek. Design to sposób działania. Musisz podejmować decyzje czy dodać przycisk z ikoną, czy może z tekstem oraz określić najlepszy rozmiar i kolor tego przycisku. Decyzje składają się na design produktu jako całości.",
    "<strong>Design is not just, like, your opinion, man.</strong> Design is testable. One design will meet a specific goal better than another design. Consider different types of bicycles. A folding bicycle has a different set of design goals than a mountain bicycle. Things like weight, size, and tire tread are important factors in helping the intended user reach their goals. Because we understand that design is about solving specific problems, we must also understand that we can objectively compare the effectiveness of two designs at solving those problems.": "<strong>Design nie jest jak twoja opinia.</strong> Design powinien być poddawany testom. Jeden projekt będzie lepszy dla uzyskania danego celu od drugiego. Wyobraź sobie sytuację, kiedy musisz wybrać rower. Zwykły składak jest zupełnie inaczej zaprojektowany niż rower górski. Cechy takie jak waga, wielkość, rodzaj kół są bardzo ważne podczas dobierania roweru dla swoich potrzeb. Skoro rozumiemy, że design to proces rozwiązywania określonych problemów musimy także zrozumieć, że problemy te możemy rozwiązać na różne sposoby. W tym celu powinniśmy wybrać naefektywniejszy z nich.",
    "Design Is Not Veneer, Aral Balkan": "Design to nie okleina, Aral Balkan",
    "Design is Not Subjective, Jeff Law": "Projektowanie nie jest subiektywne, Jeff Law",
    "Concision": "Zwięzłość",
    "Always work to make your app instantly understandable. The main function of your app should be immediately apparent. You can do this in a number of ways, but one of the best ways is by sticking to a principal of concision.": "Zawsze staraj się, aby twoja aplikacja była cały czas czytelna. Główne przeznaczenie twojej aplikacji powinno być zawsze od razu zauważone. Możesz tego dokonać na różne sposoby, lecz jednym z najlepszych z nich jest zasada zwięzłości.",
    "Avoid Feature Bloat": "Unikaj przeładowania",
    "It's often very tempting to continue adding more and more features into your application. However, it is important to recognize that every new feature has a price. Specifically, every time you add a new feature:": "Często kuszące jest dodawanie coraz to nowych funkcjonalności do aplikacji. Powinieneś jednak pamiętać, że każda z nich ma swoją cenę. Za każdym razem gdy dodajesz nową funkcjonalność to:",
    "Your application gets slower, consumes more resources, and takes up more disk space.": "Twoja aplikacja zwalnia, pobiera więcej zasobów oraz zajmuje więcej miejsca na dysku twardym",
    "Your application's interface becomes more cluttered and thus harder to use.": "Interfejs twojej aplikacji zaczyna być coraz bardziej zaśmiecony i co się z tym wiąże trudniejszy w użyciu.",
    "More time is spent implementing this new feature, rather than perfecting an old feature.": "Im więcej czasu poświęcasz na dodawanie nowych funkcjonalności, tym mniej masz na udoskonalenie starej.",
    "More code can often mean a greater possibility for bugs.": "Więcej kodu zazwyczaj oznacza większą szansę na wystąpienie błędu.",
    "More features means more work on documentation, translations, etc.": "Więcej cech oznacza więcej pracy nad dokumentacją, tłumaczeniami itp.",
    "Think in Modules": "Myśl modułowo",
    "Build small, modular apps that communicate well. elementary apps avoid feature overlap and make their functions available to other apps either through <a href=\"#contractor\">Contractor</a> or over <a href=\"http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus\" title=\"View D-Bus docs from FreeDesktop.Org\">D-Bus</a>. This both saves you time as a developer (by other apps making their functions available to you), and is a courteous gesture towards other developers (by making your app's functions available to them).": "Buduj małe, modularne aplikacje które dobrze się ze sobą komunikują. Główne aplikacje niech unikają przeładowania funkcjonalnościami oraz niech udostępniają swoje funkcjonalności dla innych aplikacji czy to przez <a href=\"#contractor\">Contractora</a> czy też przez <a href=\"http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus\" title=\"View D-Bus docs from FreeDesktop.Org\">D-Bus</a>. Oba rozwiązania zaoszczędzą Ci mnóstwo czasu jako programiście (możesz korzystać z funkcji innych aplikacji) oraz jest to miły akcent w stosunku do innych twórców aplikacji (oddając część funkcjonalności swojej aplikacji innym).",
    "Avoid Configuration": "Unikaj konfiguracji",
    "If possible, completely avoid presenting any settings or configuration in your app. Providing settings is usually an easy way out of making design decisions about an app's behavior. But just like with problems of feature bloat, settings mean more code, more bugs, more testing, more documentation, and more complexity.": "Jeżeli to możliwe, unikaj stosowania widoków opcji lub konfiguracji twojej aplikacji. Dawanie użytkownikowi panelu opcji jest łatwą drogą do zmiany zachowywania się aplikacji. Jak to bywa podczas przeładowania funkcjonalnościami, możliwość ustawiania opcji oznacza więcej kodu, błędów, testów, dokumentacji i większej złożoności programu.",
    "Build for the &quot;Out of The Box&quot; Experience": "Twórz od razu wbudowane funkcjonalności",
    "Design with sane defaults in mind. elementary apps put strong emphasis on the out of the box experience. If your app has to be configured before a user is comfortable using it, they may not take the time to configure it at all and simply use another app instead.": "Projektując aplikacje miej na uwadze, że większość funkcjonalności twojej aplikacji powinna być od razu dostępna. Jeżeli twoja aplikacja będzie wymagała konfiguracji przed użyciem, to użytkownik może nie chcieć jej używać w ogóle i poszukać konkurencyjnego produktu, który tego nie będzie wymagał.",
    "Ask the Operating System": "Zapytaj System Operacyjny",
    "Get as much information automatically as possible. Instead of asking a user for their name or their location, ask the system for this information. This cuts down on the amount of things a user has to do and makes your app look intelligent and integrated.": "Zbierz jak najwięcej informacji. Zamiast pytać użytkownika o jego aktualne miejsce gdzie przebywa, zapytaj o to system. Zmniejszy to liczbę rzeczy, którą będzie musiał zajmować się użytkownik i sprawi, że twoja aplikacja będzie wyglądała na bardziej zaawansowaną i zintegrowaną z systemem użytkownika.",
    "Do You Really Need It?": "Czy na prawdę tego potrzebujesz?",
    "Ask yourself if the configuration option you are adding is really necessary or makes sense to a user. Don't ever ask users to make engineering or design decisions.": "Zapytaj siebie czy kolejna opcja do konfiguracji jest naprawdę potrzebna, lub czy będzie potrzebna użytkownikom. Nie pytaj użytkowników o takie rzeczy - od tego są inżynierowie i projektanci.",
    "When You Absolutely Have To": "Gdy Absolutnie Musisz",
    "Keep things contextual. Instead of tucking away preferences in a configuration dialog, think about displaying them in context with the objects they affect (much like how shuffle and repeat options appear near your music library).": "Zachowaj kontekstowość. Zamiast przesuwać preferencje do okienka konfiguracyjnego, rozważ wyświetlenie ich  w kontekście z obiektem, którego dotyczą ( bardziej jak opcje tasowania i powtarzania pojawiają się obok twojej biblioteki muzycznej). ",
    "If your app needs to be configured before it can be used (like a mail client), present this configuration inside the main window much like a <a href=\"#welcome-screen\">Welcome Screen</a>. Once again, make sure this is really necessary set-up. Adding unnecessary configuration screens stops users from doing what they wanted to do when they opened your app in the first place.": "Jeżeli twoja aplikacji wymaga wcześniejszej konfiguracji przed użyciem (np. jak klient e-mail), to postaraj się zaprezentować ten krok w głównym oknie jak <a href=\"#welcome-screen\">Ekran powitalny</a>. Upewnij się, że jesto to naprawdę wymagane. Dodawanie niepotrzebnych kroków i/lub ekranów z opcjami konfiguracji powstrzymuje użytkowników przed rozpoczęciem używania Twojej aplikacji do celów których została ona docelowo stworzona.",

    "Required Configuration": "Wymagana Konfiguracja",
    "When a user first launches an app, they should be able to get down to business as quickly as possible.

If configuration is required (like in Postler), they should be presented with a clean and simple <a href=\"#welcome-screen\">welcome screen</a> within the app (again, like Postler). Avoid separate configuration dialogs when launching.": "Po pierwszym uruchomieniu aplikacji, użytkownik powinien być w stanie od razu z niej korzystać. Jeżeli konfiguracja nie jest absolutnie konieczna do użycia aplikacji po raz pierwszy, nie powinna być ona wymagana.

If your app has to configure things in the background before visibly launching, it gives the user the impression that the app is slow or will take a long time to start up. Instead, focus on making the application window appear fast and ready to be used, then do any background tasks behind the scenes. If the background task is blocking (ie. the user is unable to perform certain tasks until it's complete), show some type of indication that a background process is happening and make the blocked user interface items insensitive (see: <a href=\"#widget-concepts\">Widget Concepts</a>).": "Pierwsze uruchomienie aplikacji to pierwsze wrażenie, jakie robi ona na użytkowniku: to szansa by pokazać jej design i szybkość. Jeśli Twoja aplikacja musi skonfigurować się w tle, zanim zostanie uruchomiona w widoczny sposób, użytkownik może odnieść wrażenie, że jest ona wolna i potrzebuje sporo czasu by się uruchomić. Zamiast tego, skup się na tym, by okno aplikacji pojawiało się szybko i by aplikacja była od razu gotowa do użycia, wszelkie działania w tle mogą ruszyć już po pojawieniu się okna aplikacji na ekranie. Jeżeli zadania w tle blokują kolejne działania (np. użytkownik nie może wykonać pewnych zadań, dopóki poprzednie nie zostaną zakończone), pokaż użytkownikowi jakiś znak, że program przeprowadza procesy w tle (patrz: <a href=\"#widget-concepts\">Pomysły na widgety</a>).",
