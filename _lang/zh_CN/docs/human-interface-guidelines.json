    "Human Interface Guidelines": "用户界面指南",
    "These guidelines are designed to help developers and designers create a beautifully consistent experience on the elementary desktop. They were written for interface designers, graphic artists and software developers who will be working on elementary OS. They will not only define specific design elements and principles, but will also instill a philosophy that will help you decide when it is appropriate to deviate from the Guidelines. Adhering to the suggestions contained here will provide many benefits:": "这些指南旨在帮助开发人员和设计师在elementary桌面上创建完美一致的体验。 它们是为将在elementary操作系统上工作的接口设计师，图形艺术家和软件开发人员编写的。 它们不仅将定义具体的设计元素和原则，而且还会灌输一种理念，帮助您决定何时偏离指南。 遵守这里包含的建议将提供许多好处：",
    "Users will learn to use your application faster because it shares common elements that they are already familiar with.": "因为用户界面指南分享用户已经熟悉的一般界面元素，所以用户能更快的学习使用你的应用。",
    "Users will accomplish tasks more quickly because you will have a straight-forward interface design that isn't confusing or difficult.": "用户将会更迅速地完成工作因为您会有一个非常直观的用户界面设计，它不会让您产生困惑或者困难。",
    "Your application will appear native to the desktop and share the same elegant look as default applications.": "你的应用将在桌面端显得像原生应用，并表现出像默认应用那样得优雅。",
    "Your application will be easier to document because an expected behavior does not require explanation.": "你的应用程序更容易写文档因为预期行为不需要解释。",
    "The amount of support you will have to provide, including bugs filed, will be lessened (for the reasons above).": "您将不得不提供的支持（包括提交的错误）的次数将会减少（出于上述原因）。",
    "To help you achieve these goals, these guidelines will cover basic interface elements, how to use them and put them together effectively, and how to make your application integrate well with the desktop. The most important thing to remember is that following these guidelines will make it easier to design a new application, not harder.": "为了帮助你完成这些目标，该手册会包含基础页面元素、如何高效的使用和排列这些元素、以及如何做将你的应用与桌面环境进行整合。最重要的一点，按照指南去做，会很容易设计和实现你的新应用。",
