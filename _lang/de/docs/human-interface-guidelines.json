    "To help you achieve these goals, these guidelines will cover basic interface elements, how to use them and put them together effectively, and how to make your application integrate well with the desktop. The most important thing to remember is that following these guidelines will make it easier to design a new application, not harder.": "Um dir zu helfen diese Ziele zu erreichen enthalten die Richtlinien Informationen zu grundlegenden Interface Elementen, wie man diese verwendet und zusammensetzt , und wie du deine Applikation am besten in den Desktop integrierst. Vergiss nicht, diesen Richtlinien zu folgen sie machen es nicht schwerer, sondern leichter eine neue Applikation zu entwickeln.",

For a quick crash course, we like &quot;The User is Drunk&quot;:": "Die Richtlinien zur Benutzeroberfläche sind keine konkreten Regeln; sie sollen flexibel und erweiterbar sein.

    "What Design Is Not": "Was Design nicht ist",
    "Before we get into all the things that make up elementary apps, there is a clarification that needs to be made. We need to understand what exactly design is about, but more importantly we want to smash two major myths:": "Bevor wir uns auf alle Bestandteile von elementary-Apps stürzen müssen wir etwas klarstellen. Wir müssen verstehen, worum es bei Design genau geht. Aber zu aller erst müssen wir zwei weit verbreitete Mythen aus der Welt schaffen:",
    "<strong>Design is not something you add on after you've completed a product.</strong> Whether you realize it or not, you are constantly designing anything you build. It is an intrinsic part of creating something. Design is not just what something looks like. It's not just the colors and fonts. Design is how it works. When you decide to add a button that does a thing, that is design. You made a decision to add a button with an icon or a label and where that button went and the size and color of that button. Decisions are designs.": "<strong>Design fügt man nicht einfach einem fertigen Produkt hinzu.</strong> Ob du es wahrnimmst oder nicht, du designt immer etwas, das du erschaffst. Es ist ein wesentlicher Bestandteil des Erschaffens. Design ist nicht nur, wie etwas aussieht. Es sind nicht nur Farben und Schriftarten. Design ist, wie es funktioniert. Wenn du sich entscheidest einen Knopf hinzuzufügen, der etwas tut, dann ist das Design. Du hast dich entschieden einen Knopf mit einem Icon oder Label hinzuzufügen. Du hast entschieden wo und wie groß er sein soll und du hast eine Farbe ausgesucht. Entscheidungen sind Design.",
    "<strong>Design is not just, like, your opinion, man.</strong> Design is testable. One design will meet a specific goal better than another design. Consider different types of bicycles. A folding bicycle has a different set of design goals than a mountain bicycle. Things like weight, size, and tire tread are important factors in helping the intended user reach their goals. Because we understand that design is about solving specific problems, we must also understand that we can objectively compare the effectiveness of two designs at solving those problems.": "<strong>Design ist nicht nur Geschmackssache.</strong> Design kann man testen. Es gibt Designs, die für eine Sache besser geeignet sind als andere. Nehmen wir beispielsweise Fahrräder: Ein Klapprad wurde aus anderen Gründen als ein Mountain Bike konzipiert. Dinge wie Gewicht und Größe sind wichtige Faktoren, um sinnvoll für den Nutzer zu sein. Da wir verstehen, dass Design dafür benutzt wird, um Probleme zu lösen, können wir auch objektiv die Effektivität zweier Designs erkennen und lösen.",

    "Design is Not Subjective, Jeff Law": "Design ist nicht subjektiv, Jeff Law",
    "Concision": "Prägnanz",
    "Always work to make your app instantly understandable. The main function of your app should be immediately apparent. You can do this in a number of ways, but one of the best ways is by sticking to a principal of concision.": "Arbeite stets daran, deine Anwendung verständlich zu gestalten. Die Hauptfunktion deiner Anwendung sollte sofort ersichtlich sein. Du kannst dies auf verschiedene Weise erreichen, aber am Besten ist es, den Grundsatz der Prägnanz zu verwenden.",
    "Avoid Feature Bloat": "Vermeide das Überladen mit Funktionen",
    "It's often very tempting to continue adding more and more features into your application. However, it is important to recognize that every new feature has a price. Specifically, every time you add a new feature:": "Oft ist die Versuchung groß, einer Anwendung immer mehr Features hinzuzufügen. Allerdings ist es wichtig einzusehen, dass jedes neue Feature seinen Preis hat. Genauer gesagt, immer wenn du ein neues Feature hinzufügst...",
    "Your application gets slower, consumes more resources, and takes up more disk space.": "Deine Applikation wird langsamer, verbraucht mehr Ressourcen und mehr Speicherplatz.",
    "Your application's interface becomes more cluttered and thus harder to use.": "...wird deine Nutzeroberfläche überladener und schwerer zu benutzen.",
    "More time is spent implementing this new feature, rather than perfecting an old feature.": "Dieses neue Feature hinzuzufügen beansprucht immer mehr Zeit, die man für das Perfektionieren eines alten Features hätte nutzen können.",
    "More code can often mean a greater possibility for bugs.": "Mehr Quelltext bringt oft auch eine größere Wahrscheinlichkeit für Bugs mit sich.",
    "More features means more work on documentation, translations, etc.": "Mehrere Funktionen bedeuten mehr Arbeit an Dokumentation, Übersetzung, etc.",
    "Think in Modules": "Denke in Modulen",
    "Build small, modular apps that communicate well. elementary apps avoid feature overlap and make their functions available to other apps either through <a href=\"#contractor\">Contractor</a> or over <a href=\"http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus\" title=\"View D-Bus docs from FreeDesktop.Org\">D-Bus</a>. This both saves you time as a developer (by other apps making their functions available to you), and is a courteous gesture towards other developers (by making your app's functions available to them).": "Erstelle kleine, modulare Anwendungen die gut miteinander kommunizieren. elementary-Apps vermeiden Funktionalitätsüberschneidungen und stellen anderen Anwendungen ihre Funktionen zur Verfügung - entweder mittels <a href=\"#contractor\"> Contractor</a> oder via <a href=\"http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus\" title=\"Lies die DBUS-Dokumentation von FreeDesktop.org\">D-Bus</a>. Das spart dir als Entwickler Zeit (weil dir andere Apps ihre Funktionen zur Verfügung stellen) und ist eine höfliche Geste an andere Entwickler (weil deine App ihnen ihre Funktionen verfügbar macht).",
    "Avoid Configuration": "Vermeide Konfiguration",
    "If possible, completely avoid presenting any settings or configuration in your app. Providing settings is usually an easy way out of making design decisions about an app's behavior. But just like with problems of feature bloat, settings mean more code, more bugs, more testing, more documentation, and more complexity.": "Wenn möglich, vermeide das Anzeigen jeglicher Einstellungen in deiner App. Durch das Anbieten von Einstellungen ist es meist einfach, Entscheidungen über das Design und das Verhalten einer App aus dem Weg zu gehen. Aber genau wie beim Überladen mit Funktionen bedeuten Einstellungen mehr Quelltext, mehr Bugs, mehr Testen, mehr Dokumentation und mehr Komplexität.",
    "Build for the &quot;Out of The Box&quot; Experience": "Erschaffe ein \"Out of the Box\" Erlebnis",
    "Design with sane defaults in mind. elementary apps put strong emphasis on the out of the box experience. If your app has to be configured before a user is comfortable using it, they may not take the time to configure it at all and simply use another app instead.": "Designe mit vernünftigen Standardwerten im Hinterkopf. elementary-Apps legen viel Wert auf ein \"Out of the Box\" Erlebnis. Wenn deine App erst angepasst werden muss, bevor ein Nutzer sie richtig benutzen kann, ist ihm das vielleicht zu zeitaufwendig und er nutzt stattdessen eine andere Anwendung.",
    "Ask the Operating System": "Frag' das Betriebssystem",
    "Get as much information automatically as possible. Instead of asking a user for their name or their location, ask the system for this information. This cuts down on the amount of things a user has to do and makes your app look intelligent and integrated.": "Erhalte so viele Informationen wie möglich automatisch. Bevor du einen Nutzer nach seinem Namen oder Aufenthaltsort fragst, frag' das System danach. Dies nimmt dem Nutzer Arbeit ab und lässt deine App intelligent und gut integriert wirken.",
    "Do You Really Need It?": "Brauchst du es wirklich?",
    "Ask yourself if the configuration option you are adding is really necessary or makes sense to a user. Don't ever ask users to make engineering or design decisions.": "Hinterfrage zuerst. ob die Einstellungen die du hinzufügst wirklich nötig sind und für einen Nutzer Sinn ergeben. Verlange niemals von einem Nutzer, Funktionalitäts- oder Designentscheidungen zu treffen.",
    "When You Absolutely Have To": "Wenn es unbedingt sein muss",
    "Keep things contextual. Instead of tucking away preferences in a configuration dialog, think about displaying them in context with the objects they affect (much like how shuffle and repeat options appear near your music library).": "Halte alles kontextbezogen. Anstatt Einstellungsmöglichkeiten in einem Konfigurationsmenü zu verstecken, versuche sie zusammen mit den Objekten anzuzeigen, die sie beeinflussen (genau wie in deiner Musiksammlung \"Shuffle\" und \"Repeat\" angezeigt werden).",
    "If your app needs to be configured before it can be used (like a mail client), present this configuration inside the main window much like a <a href=\"#welcome-screen\">Welcome Screen</a>. Once again, make sure this is really necessary set-up. Adding unnecessary configuration screens stops users from doing what they wanted to do when they opened your app in the first place.": "Wenn deine Anwendungen eingerichtet werden müssen, bevor man sie verwenden kann (wie ein Email-Programm), dann zeige dieses Einstelung innerhalb des Hauptfensters wie ein  <a href=\"#welcome-screen\">Wilkommensbildschirm</a>. Noch einmal, versichere dich, dass es eine wirklich notwendige Einstellung ist.

    "<strong>Normal Launch</strong>: What happens when opening your app on a day-to-day basis.": "<strong>Normaler Start</strong>: Was geschieht, wenn deine App täglich benutzt wird.",
    "<strong>Closing</strong>: What happens when closing your app.": "<strong>Schließen</strong>: Was passiet, wenn deine Anwendung geschlossen wird.",
    "<strong>Background Tasks</strong>: How your app manages to do things invisibly in the background.": "<strong>Hintergrundaufgaben</strong>: Wie deine App Dinge unsichtbar im Hintergrund erledigt.",
    "First-Launch Experience": "Erststart Erfahrung",
    "Required Configuration": "Benötigte Konfiguration",
    "When a user first launches an app, they should be able to get down to business as quickly as possible. If configuration is not absolutely required for the first use, they should not be required to configure anything. If configuration is required (like in Postler), they should be presented with a clean and simple <a href=\"#welcome-screen\">welcome screen</a> within the app (again, like Postler). Avoid separate configuration dialogs when launching.": "Wenn der Nutzer eine App zum ersten Mal startet, sollte er so schnell wie möglich zur Sache kommen können. Wenn das Konfigurieren der App für den ersten Start nicht unbedingt notwendig ist, sollte das auch nicht verlangt werden. Wenn Konfigruation aber notwendig ist (wie in Postler), sollte in der App ein klarer und einfacher <a href=\"#welcome-screen\">Willkommensbildschirm</a> gezeigt werden (wieder wie in Postler). Vermeide neue Fenster mit Konfigurationsdialogen beim Starten der App. ",
    "Speed of Launch": "Startgeschwindigkeit",
    "Your app's first launch is the user's first impression of your app; it's a chance to really show off its design and speed. If your app has to configure things in the background before visibly launching, it gives the user the impression that the app is slow or will take a long time to start up. Instead, focus on making the application window appear fast and ready to be used, then do any background tasks behind the scenes. If the background task is blocking (ie. the user is unable to perform certain tasks until it's complete), show some type of indication that a background process is happening and make the blocked user interface items insensitive (see: <a href=\"#widget-concepts\">Widget Concepts</a>).": "Der erste Start Deiner App prägt beim Nutzer den ersten Eindruck. Hier ist die Chance, Design und Geschwindigkeit der App ins rechte Licht zu rücken. Wenn sich die App vor dem Erscheinen auf dem Bildschirm noch im Hintergrund konfiguriert, erhält der Nutzer den Eindruck, dass sie langsam läuft oder lange Zeit zum Starten braucht. Sorge deshalb dafür, dass das Appfenster schnell erscheint und bereit zur Nutzung ist, und lasse dann Konfigurationsarbeiten im Hintergrund laufen. Wenn solche Hintergrundarbeiten das Nutzen von bestimmten Funktionen blockieren, zeige eine Information über laufende Hintergrundprozesse an und deaktiviere die entsprechenden Oberflächenelemente (siehe <a href=\"#widget-concepts\">Widgetkonzepte</a>)",

",
    "Normal Launch": "Normaler Start",

You should focus on three key areas for app launching: speed, obviousness of what to do next, and state.": "Wenn der Nutzer eine App startet, tut sie das ausdrücklich und  erwartet eine schnelle, meist sofortige Reaktion. Für den Start einer App solltest Du drei Schlüsselaspekte im Auge behalten: Geschwindigkeit, klare Hinweise auf die nächsten Schritte und aktueller Status der App. ",

There should be as little delay as possible in between the time a user decides to launch an app and the instant they can begin using it.

Es sollte so wenig wie möglich Zeit vergehen zwischen der Entscheidung der Nutzerin, eine App zu starten und dem Moment, in dem die App benutzbar ist. Wenn deine App einen splash screen braucht, machst du etwas falsch. ",
    "Obviousness": "Offensichtlichkeit",
    "When a user launches your app, they should know exactly what to do next. This is achieved by following the other interface guidelines (ensuring your app is consistent with other apps) and by offering up explicit actions from the get go. If the app typically displays &quot;items,&quot; such as songs or emails, let the user get at those items by displaying them when the app opens. If there are no previously-opened items, you should offer to open or create a new item (such as a document) by using a <a href=\"#welcome-screen\">welcome screen</a>.": "Wenn eine Nutzerin deine App startet, sollte sie genau wissen, was als nächstes zu tun ist. Das lässt sich bewerkstelligen durch Einhaltung der Richtlinien zur Benutzeroberfläche (womit die App konsistent mit anderen Apps wird) und durch das sofortige Anbieten klar definierter Aktionen. Wenn die App typischerweise \"items\" wie etwa Songs oder Emails anzeigt, zeige dem Nutzer diese sofort wenn die App startet. Wenn es solche vorher geöffneten bzw. erstellten items nicht gibt, solltest Du dem Nutzer auf einem <a href=\"#welcome-screen\">Willkommensbildschrim</a> anbieten, ein neues zu erstellen bzw. ein vorhandenes zu öffnen (z.B. ein Dokument)",

    "If the user has previously used your app, it's typically best to restore the state of the app when opening it again. This means the app comes up to right where the user left off so they can pick up their work again. For a music player, this means opening up with the view where the user left it and the song paused where the user closed the app. For a document editor, this would mean opening up with the same document scrolled to the same spot with the cursor in the same spot on the page.": "Wenn der Nutzer deine App schon einmal benutzt hab, ist es häufig das Beste, den Stand der Dinge beim erneuten Starten wiederherzustellen. Das heißt, die App startet mit genau demselben Zustand, den der Nutzer beim letzten Schließen hinterlassen hat, sodass er sofort weiterarbeiten kann. Ein Musikplayer startet dann in der Ansicht, die beim letzten Beenden aktiv war und mit dem zuletzt abgespielten, nunmehr pausierten Song. Ein Dokumenteditor startet dann mit demselben Dokument zeigt dieselbe Stelle im Dokument an und setzt den Cursor an dieselbe Stelle wie beim letzten Schließen der App. ",
    "Always Provide an Undo": "Always Provide an Undo",

    "<strong>Deleting an item</strong>. Instead of asking the user if they are sure, make the item &quot;disappear&quot; from the app, but provide an easy and intuitive way to undo the delete.": "<strong>Löschen eines Objekts</strong>. Anstatt den Nutzer zu fragen, ob er sich sicher ist, lasse das Objekt von der Oberfläche der App \"verschwinden\", und zeige dem Nutzer einen einfachen und intuitiven Weg, das Löschen rückgängig zu machen.",
    "<strong>Sending an email</strong>. Rather than asking the user if they want to send an email, let them undo or edit the message a short time after &quot;sending.&quot;": "<strong>Eine Email senden</strong>. Anstatt den Benutzer zu fragen, ob er eine Email senden möchte, erlauben Sie im die Nachricht rückgängig oder bearbeiten zu lassen, nachdem er auf \"Senden\" gedrückt hat.",
    "<strong>Editing a photo</strong>. Instead of asking the user if they want to destructively apply an edit, let them undo the edit and always keep the original backed up.": "<strong>Editing a photo</strong>. Instead of asking the user if they want to destructively apply an edit, let them undo the edit and always keep the original backed up.",
    "This behavior should only as a last resort be implemented by providing a buffer time between when the app shows the user what happened and actually performing the action. To keep the experience responsive, the app should always look as if it performed the action as soon as the user initiates it. ": "This behavior should only as a last resort be implemented by providing a buffer time between when the app shows the user what happened and actually performing the action. To keep the experience responsive, the app should always look as if it performed the action as soon as the user initiates it.",
    "This behavior strikes the best balance of keeping out of the user's way while making sure they don't do something unintended. It's important to keep the undo action unobtrusive yet simple and intuitive; a common way of doing so is by using an info bar, though other methods may also be appropriate.": "Dieses Verhalten erreicht die beste Balance zwischen einem unterbrechungsfreien Arbeiten des Nutzers und der Verhinderung vom Nutzer ungewollter Aktionen. Es ist wichtig, die Rückgängig-Funktion unaufdringlich und intuitiv zu halten. Üblicherweise wird dazu eine Infoleiste verwendet, wobei auch andere Methoden auch hilfreich sein können. ",

    "Apps in elementary should operate around an always-saved state. This means that changes the user makes are instantly applied and visible and that making the user manually save things is a legacy or specialized behavior.": "Anwendungen in elementary sollten in einem \"immer-gespeichert\" Modus operieren. Das heißt, dass Änderungen, welche der Nutzer vollzieht, sofort vollzogen und sichtbar gemacht werden und dass der Nutzer nur in speziellen Fällen manuell speichern muss.",
    "For example, a Song Info dialog should update the track information instantly without a user having to press a save button, user preferences should be applied as soon as the user manipulates the relevant widget, and closing an app should mean that reopening it will return to where the user left off.": "Zum Beispiel sollte ein Lied-Infodialog die Stückinformationen sofort aktualisieren, ohne das der Nutzer eine Taste drücken muss, Nutzereinstellungen sollten angewendet werden, sobald der Nutzer das relevante Widget ändert und Schließen einer Anwendung sollte voraussetzen, dass erneutes Öffnen die Anwendung so zurückbringt, wie sie vor dem Schließen verlassen wurde.",

    "Saving State": "Den aktuellen Zustand speichern",
    "Apps should save their current state when closed so they can be reopened right to where the user left off. Ideally closing and reopening an app should be indistinguishable from the traditional concept of minimizing and unminimizing an app; that is, all elements should be saved including open documents, scroll position, undo history, etc.": "Apps sollten ihren aktuellen Zustand beim Schließen speichern, sodass sie beim nächsten Öffnen genau so erscheinen, wie sie der Nutzer verlassen hat.

    "Background Tasks": "Hintergrund Anwendungen",
    "If it makes sense for an app to complete background tasks after the window is closed, the tasks should be completed soon after the window is closed. If the app performs repeat background tasks (such as a mail client), the background tasks should be handled by a separate daemon that does not rely on the app itself being open.": "Wenn es für eine App sinnvoll ist, Hintergrundaufgaben zu Ende zu bringen, nachdem das Fenster geschlossen wurde, sollen diese Prozesse bald nach Schließen des Fensters beendet sein.

If it makes sense to continue a process in the background (such as downloading/transferring, playing music, or executing a terminal command) the app backend should continue with the task and close when the task is finished. If it's not immediately apparent that the process has completed (as with the file download/transfer or terminal command), the app may show a notification informing the user that the process has completed. If it is apparent, as with the music, no notification is necessary.": "Wenn ein Nutzer eine App schließen will, sollte diese sich nicht nur minimieren. Stattdessen sollte das Fenster \"versteckt\" werden. Es ergibt Sinn Prozesse (wie z.B. Downloads/Datentransfer, Musik hören, ein Befehl im Terminal ausführen) im Hintergrund auszuführen und sie dann zu beenden, wenn sie fertig sind. Sollte es nicht offensichtlich sein, dass ein Hintergrundprozess beendet worden ist (wie bei einem Download/ Datentransfer oder Terminal-Befehl), so könnte die App eine Benachrichtigung ausgeben, um den Nutzer über die Beendigung zu informieren.
